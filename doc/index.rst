Rings: efficient Java/Scala library for polynomial rings
########################################################

|Rings| is an efficient implementation of both univariate and multivariate polynomial algebra over arbitrary coefficient rings. |Rings| make use of asymptotically fast algorithms for basic algebraic operations as well as for advanced methods like GCDs and polynomial factorization and give performance comparable (or even better in some cases) to well known solutions like Singular/NTL/FLINT/Maple/Mathematica.

   environment
      A structure where information about all documents under the root is
      saved, and used for cross-referencing.  The environment is pickled
      after the parsing stage, so that successive runs only need to read
      and parse new and changed documents.

   source directory
      The directory which, including its subdirectories, contains all
      source files for one Sphinx project.

**Features:**


 * Univariate and multivariate polynomials over arbitrary coefficient rings

 * Polynomial factorization and GCDs over arbitrary coefficient rings
 
 * Galois fields and abstract algebra
 
 * Efficient implementation and overall high performance
